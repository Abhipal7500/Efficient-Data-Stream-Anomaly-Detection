# This code creates and trains an Isolation Forest model using scikit-learn's IsolationForest module.

# Importing essential libraries:
# NumPy for array operations, IsolationForest for anomaly detection, 
# and joblib's dump to save the model to a file.

import random
from joblib import dump
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

def model():
    # Initialize a random number generator with a seed for consistent results
    rng = np.random.RandomState(100)

    # Create synthetic training data
    X = 0.3 * rng.randn(500, 1)
    X_train = np.r_[X + 2]  # Adjusting the distribution
    X_train = np.round(X_train, 3)

    # Train an Isolation Forest model
    clf = IsolationForest(
        n_estimators=50,
        max_samples=500,
        random_state=rng,
        contamination=0.01  # Setting contamination to identify outliers
    )
    clf.fit(X_train)

    # Save the trained model to a file named 'isolation_forest.joblib'
